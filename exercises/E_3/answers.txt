1. When smoothing the CPU temperature, Kalman smoothing delivered better results. The resulting smoothing was more accurate
and closer to the observations than the LOESS smoothing because they take more information into account. Moreover, the
LOESS smoothing does not take as much information and is less accurate.

2. Those extra variables can be used to create a multivariate reggresional model or another statistical model
that will help us determine the next coordinates. With the more data, it could help us be more accurate. However, there
is a chance of overfitting.
