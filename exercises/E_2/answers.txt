1. The result of this calculation is: timestamp values (x:in seconds) multiplied by the slope(m) of the best fit line
   plus the y intercept(b). This is classic y = mx + b. The type of value is a number (float) representing a potential
   score based on the timestamp. The values of y represent a prediction based on the linear regresstion model of the
   data.

2. This produces a fit line on the graph because the x values being used for the model are the timestamps which are
   just another representation of the date object, therefore, there are also an equal amount of them. The y values are
   the same as the data. On the graph, the ratings (y axis) are not changing and only the x axis is. Therefore, when we
   plot the line, the x values are paired correctly because there are an equal amount and the y values are properly fit
   for the line.
