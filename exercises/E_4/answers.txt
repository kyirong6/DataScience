1. Based on the graph, I think that it is not a good way to predict population density. There does not seem to be an
obvious relation between temperature and populaton desnity. The data does not suggest a linear relation.

2. Upon analyzing the uncompressed file in comparison to the compressed file, the uncompressed file is 1.2MB while the
compressed file is 262KB. This is a significant difference and will contribute to the efficiency of the program. Moreover,
because gzip can compress and decompress on the fly very quickly, it ends up being more efficient this way when exchanging
data.
