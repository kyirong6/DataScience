1. np.sqrt

2. The orignal t-test tried to deduce how likely the population means of the 2 data sets (weekday vs weekend containing
subreddit canada, 2012/2013) are the same using their corresponding sample data. The test yielded a strong case for
rejecting the null hypothesis. The transformed t-test performed the t-test on transformed data due to the original data not
aligning with the assumptions (skewness, failing normality test, etc...). This transformation and test answers a slightly
different question. How likely are the population means of the transformed data equal to each other? If we are rejecting
the null hypothesis, this would mean the sample means of the transformed data are likely to be different.

3. Even though the CLT in our exercise is looking at the distribution of our sample means, this test seems most appropriate
as it will test the equality of means of sample means of the weekly data. From the resulting t-test, it is reasonable to
infer one is different than the other from the resulting p value.

4. Based on our tests, we aren't able to get this answer. However, upon further analysis, it would be weekends.
