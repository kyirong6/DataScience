1. SVM classifier with RGB did the best. This is may be because the data is naturally not split linearly and using
the rbf parameter is perfect for this situation. Moreover, SVM finds an optimal boundary between the categories which
is great for this type of data.

2. Yes, these are reasonable mistakes because the locations that are incorrect are close to each other. Therefore, they
will have similar data points. Some additional features may decrease the incorrect predictions: humidity, number of snow days,
number of rain days, sunshine hours.
