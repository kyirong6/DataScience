1. I cached three time. Once in the initial spark.read(), another on the first filter, and another on the second filter. If
you didn't use cache anywhere it would have slowed down the program because of lazy evaluations. It wont store the results for
later use.

2. Without broadcasting: 47.767s. With broadcasting: 39.033s. Using the broadcasting improved the speed of the program.
